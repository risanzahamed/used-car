Project Description: 

This is a website which i created for selling best quality used car. In this website I use React, Tailwind, MongoDb, Firebase and more. 

1st in the Home page I create a hero section and Some of car features sections. And added a car category section. But the car category section is a private section / Route no one can see the category wise car without login or signup. So when a user sign in they will see the Category wise products.  In the Product section I add all of the details about the product and when a user like the product they can book the product and The product automatically added to they dashboard order route. A user/ Customer can also report to admin in any product. When they click on Report to admin that item will added to the report/ flaged items route. And its only admin route no one can see this without an admin.I also implement JWT token feature.

On the seller, if anyone create about for sell product they can add product, advertising there product. And its also seller only private route.


On the admin,  If anyone is admin in the site that admin will see the dashboard with Flaged Items, Seller, Customer,  All Users Route.
